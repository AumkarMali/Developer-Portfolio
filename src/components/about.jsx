            I discovered my passion for programming when I was just 14 years old. What started as a hobby soon turned into a full-fledged passion for web development and software engineering. Over the years, I honed my skills in languages like Python, Java, and C++, as well as frameworks such as React and Flask. In my early days, I focused on building small projects and experimenting with various development tools and libraries. By taking on freelance projects, I also learned the importance of delivering high-quality, bug-free software in tight deadlines.
